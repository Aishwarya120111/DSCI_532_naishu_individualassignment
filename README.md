## Motivation

Target audience: Aviation industry analysts, and service providers

The dashboard provides a simple yet powerful tool for anyone involved in the aviation industry worldwide.It's designed to help those who manage, analyze, or plan air transport services, including those overseeing heliports, small airfields, and large international airports. It aids decision-making in aviation, from route planning to infrastructure investment. Hereâ€™s how the dashboard serves its purpose:

- It shows how many heliport and airport facilities (large, small, medium) there are, where they're located globally, and breaks it down further within country and its provinces.
- The map makes it easy to see the spread of airports and heliports at a glance, which is super helpful for planning routes or expanding services.

For anyone who needs to keep an eye on where air transport facilities are and how they're spread out, this dashboard makes that job a lot easier. It helps in making smart decisions on how to grow, where to focus resources, and how to better serve passengers and businesses.

## App Description

- Interactive filters for types of aviation data analysis.
